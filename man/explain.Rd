\title{Create Model Explainer}
\usage{
explain(model, data = NULL, y = NULL, predict.function = yhat,
  label = tail(class(model), 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{object - a model to be explained}

\item{data}{data.frame or marix - data that was used for fitting. If not provided then will be extracted from model fit}

\item{predict.function}{function that takes two arguments: model and new data and returns numeric vector with predictions}

\item{label}{character - the name of the model. By default it's extracted from the 'class' attribute of the model}

\item{...}{other parameters}
}
\value{
An object of the class 'explainer'.

It's a list with following fields:

* \code{model} the explained model
* \code{data} the dataset used for training
* \code{predict.function} function that may be used for model predictions, shall return a single numerical value for each observation.
* \code{class} class/classess of a model
* \code{label} label, by default it's the last value from the \code{class} vector, but may be set to any character.
}
\description{
Black-box models may have very different structures.
This function creates a unified representation of a model, which can be further processed by various explainers.
